## Understanding the Latency Indicator
The colored dot on the transcription overlay shows your current performance:

- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow**: Good latency (2-4 seconds)  
- **ðŸ”´ Red**: High latency (> 4 seconds)

## Troubleshooting
- If you see "ElevenLabs API key not configured", make sure you've entered your API key
- If no transcriptions appear, make sure the stream is playing and has audio
- If the extension doesn't work, try refreshing the page and restarting transcription
- If you see red latency indicator, try switching to a lower latency mode or check your internet connection
